# Project Progress & Intent

## Project Intent

### Purpose

Build a proof of concept that demonstrates enterprise-grade capability to manage multiple business-unit (BU) design systems on top of MUI, including the layers MUI does not provide out of the box: governance, token orchestration, deterministic theme compilation, validation, versioning discipline, and a clear scaling path.

This is not a "theme switcher" demo. It is a multi-BU design system platform slice, implemented as a high-quality, reviewable engineering artifact.

### What this POC Must Prove

A reviewer should conclude:

- The design system is token-driven, not hardcoded styling
- Multiple BUs can share the same component APIs while expressing different brands
- Governance exists as enforcement (CI and validation), not tribal knowledge
- The system scales beyond two BUs with clear extension points (currently supports three BUs: Core Banking, Growth/Payments, Wealth Management)
- **MUI is an adapter layer, not the design system itself** - the design system is defined at the token and theme engine layers

### Success Criteria

✅ **All Met:**

- ✅ Token-driven architecture - No hardcoded values in components
- ✅ Multi-BU support - Three fully realized BUs share component APIs
- ✅ Governance enforcement - Validation, versioning, and linting enforced in CI
- ✅ Versioning discipline - Token versioning system with enforcement
- ✅ Token diffing - Scripts for comparing tokens and tracking changes
- ✅ Theme packaging - Themes packaged as consumable libraries
- ✅ Storybook theme switching - Theme switcher for all three BUs
- ✅ Demo site - Runtime BU switching at application scale
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation - Architecture, pipeline, governance, consumption guides

## Fintech Business Unit Implementation

**Date:** 2024-12-21

### Overview

Replaced generic BU A and BU B with two fintech business units by adjusting values within existing token categories only. No new categories, names, or structural changes were introduced.

### Core Banking Platform (bu-a)

**Visual Intent:** Conservative, dense, predictable, low visual noise  
**Use Case:** Internal, regulated, operational tooling

**Token Adjustments:**

1. **Palette (`tokens/bu-a/palette.json`)**

   - Primary: Shifted to deeper navy-blue tones (#3A5B81 at 500) for professional, trustworthy appearance
   - Secondary: Muted gray-blue tones (#818D9F at 500) for conservative, low-visual-noise aesthetic
   - **Existing tokens used:** `primary`, `secondary` color ramps (50-900 scale)

2. **Typography (`tokens/bu-a/typography.json`)**

   - Base font size: Reduced from 1rem to 0.875rem for denser information display
   - Font size scale: Proportionally reduced (xs: 0.6875rem, sm: 0.8125rem, etc.)
   - **Existing tokens used:** `fontSize` scale (xs, sm, base, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl, 4xl)

3. **Semantic (`tokens/bu-a/semantic.json`)**
   - Text primary: Higher contrast using `palette.neutral.900` (darker)
   - Text secondary: More distinct using `palette.neutral.800` (darker than core)
   - Border default: More defined using `palette.neutral.400` (darker than core's 300)
   - **Existing tokens used:** `text.primary`, `text.secondary`, `border.default`

**Visual Result:** Denser layout, higher contrast, more defined boundaries, professional appearance

### Growth & Payments Experience (bu-b)

**Visual Intent:** Expressive, spacious, modern, approachable  
**Use Case:** External-facing, revenue and conversion focused

**Token Adjustments:**

1. **Palette (`tokens/bu-b/palette.json`)**

   - Primary: Vibrant cyan/blue-green tones (#00BCD4 at 500) for energetic, growth-oriented feel
   - Secondary: Warm amber/yellow tones (#FFC107 at 500) for approachable, conversion-focused accent
   - **Existing tokens used:** `primary`, `secondary` color ramps (50-900 scale)

2. **Typography (`tokens/bu-b/typography.json`)**

   - Base font size: Increased from 1rem to 1.125rem for more spacious, readable display
   - Font size scale: Proportionally increased (xs: 0.875rem, sm: 1rem, etc.)
   - **Existing tokens used:** `fontSize` scale (xs, sm, base, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl, 4xl)

3. **Semantic (`tokens/bu-b/semantic.json`)**
   - Text primary: Softer contrast using `palette.neutral.800` (lighter than Core Banking)
   - Text secondary: More subtle using `palette.neutral.600` (lighter than Core Banking)
   - Border default: Lighter using `palette.neutral.200` (softer than Core Banking's 400)
   - **Existing tokens used:** `text.primary`, `text.secondary`, `border.default`

**Visual Result:** More spacious layout, softer colors, lighter borders, modern and approachable appearance

### Storybook Updates

**File:** `storybook/.storybook/preview.tsx`

- Updated labels from "BU A" / "BU B" to full business unit names:
  - "Core Banking Platform"
  - "Growth & Payments Experience"
- Updated Chromatic visual regression modes to use full names
- All decorator logic preserved unchanged

### Theme File Documentation

**Files Updated:**

- `packages/themes/src/bu-a.ts` - Added comment describing Core Banking Platform
- `packages/themes/src/bu-b.ts` - Added comment describing Growth & Payments Experience
- `packages/themes/src/index.ts` - Added business unit descriptions in package documentation

### Validation

**Token Validation:** ✅ All tokens pass schema validation

- Run: `pnpm run validate:tokens`
- Result: All token files valid, no schema violations

### Limitations & Constraints

**What Was NOT Changed:**

- No new token categories introduced
- No new token names within existing categories
- No component API changes
- No theme engine logic changes
- No new abstraction layers

**Shared Tokens (Not Differentiated):**

- **Spacing:** Remains in `tokens/core/spacing.json` - shared across all BUs
  - _Limitation:_ Cannot differentiate density through spacing tokens without creating BU-specific spacing files
  - _Workaround:_ Typography size adjustments help create visual density perception
- **Shape (borderRadius/elevation):** Remains in `tokens/core/shape.json` - shared across all BUs
  - _Limitation:_ Cannot differentiate angular vs. rounded aesthetics without BU-specific shape tokens
  - _Note:_ This limitation is acceptable for current visual differentiation goals

**Achieved Differentiation:**

- ✅ Color palette (primary/secondary) - distinct visual identity
- ✅ Typography scale - density vs. spaciousness
- ✅ Text contrast - conservative vs. approachable
- ✅ Border definition - structured vs. soft

### Visual Differentiation Summary

The two business units are now visually distinct:

- **Core Banking Platform:** Deeper blues, smaller fonts, higher contrast, defined borders → conservative, dense, professional
- **Growth & Payments Experience:** Vibrant cyan, larger fonts, softer contrast, lighter borders → expressive, spacious, modern

Differences are immediately obvious when viewing the same component side-by-side in Storybook.

## Atomic Design Reorganization

**Date:** 2024-12-21

### Overview

Reorganized the component library to follow atomic design principles, creating a clear hierarchy: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages.

### Implementation

**Directory Structure:**

- Created atomic-level directories: `atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`, `templates/`, `pages/`
- Moved existing components to appropriate levels:
  - Atoms: `Typography`, `Button`
  - Molecules: `TextField`, `Alert`
  - Organisms: `Card`

**New Components:**

- `FormLayout` (Template): Minimal template demonstrating form structure with token-driven styling
- `LoginPage` (Page): Minimal page example demonstrating template usage and composition

**Token Paradigm:**

- All components/templates/pages follow token paradigm: consume meaning (semantic tokens), not values (raw tokens)
- All styling via MUI's `sx` prop, `Box`, `Stack`, `Container` - no custom CSS files
- Spacing from `theme.spacing()` (maps to tokens)
- Colors use semantic meaning via MUI palette (`theme.palette.background.default`, `theme.palette.divider`)

**Storybook Updates:**

- Updated story titles to reflect atomic structure: `Atoms/Button`, `Molecules/TextField`, etc.
- Added stories for `FormLayout` (Template) and `LoginPage` (Page)
- All imports maintained backward compatibility via root `@multi-bu/ui` exports

**Exports:**

- Maintained backward-compatible flat exports from root `index.ts`
- Added atomic-level exports for new organization
- All existing imports continue to work

**Documentation:**

- Documented atomic design principles and token paradigm
- Updated `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` with reorganization details

### Key Principles Enforced

1. **Atomic Design Hierarchy**: Clear organization from atoms to pages
2. **Token-Driven**: All visual values trace to design tokens
3. **Semantic Consumption**: Components use semantic tokens (meaning), not raw tokens (values)
4. **MUI-Only Styling**: No custom CSS files, all styling via MUI's system
5. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing imports continue to work

## Enhancement Cycle: Production Readiness

**Date Started:** 2024-12-21  
**Objective:** Transform POC into production-ready multi-BU design system platform

### Current Status Before Enhancement

**Completed:**

- ✅ Core token schema and validation system (DTCG format)
- ✅ Theme compilation engine with deterministic output
- ✅ Two complete BUs (A and B) with visual divergence
- ✅ Component wrapper library (atomic design structure)
- ✅ Storybook with side-by-side theme comparison
- ✅ Governance automation (token validation, linting)
- ✅ Basic documentation

**Needs Enhancement:**

- ⚠️ BU C exists but has fragmented structure (needs consolidation to single `tokens.json`)
- ⚠️ No token versioning system
- ⚠️ No token diff script for governance
- ⚠️ Storybook uses side-by-side decorator (needs theme switching addon)
- ⚠️ No demo site demonstrating runtime BU switching
- ⚠️ Documentation needs enhancement for hiring manager review

### Phase 0: Analysis and Intent Alignment ✅

**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** 2024-12-21

- Analyzed current state and documented findings
- Clarified project intent:
  - Tokens as single source of truth
  - Multi-BU scope (3 BUs: Core Banking, Growth/Payments, Wealth Management)
  - Reinforce MUI as adapter layer, not the design system itself
- Updated `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` with enhancement cycle entry

**Next Steps:** Phase 1 - Token Governance, Versioning, and BU C Alignment

---

### Phase 1: Token Governance, Versioning, and BU C Alignment ✅

**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** 2024-12-21

**BU C Consolidation:**

- ✅ Fixed BU C's fragmented structure - consolidated from separate files (`palette.json`, `semantic.json`, `typography.json`) to unified `tokens.json` format matching BU A/B structure
- ✅ Deleted old fragmented files (palette.json, semantic.json, typography.json)
- ✅ Updated browser token loader to use consolidated `tokens.json` instead of fragmented structure
- ✅ BU C now structurally consistent with BU A and BU B - all use single `tokens.json` file in DTCG format
- Defined Wealth Management design direction: sophisticated, premium, elegant
- Primary color: Rich deep purple/indigo (#673AB7) - sophisticated, refined
- Secondary color: Warm gold/amber (#FFC107) - premium accent
- Typography: Balanced sizing (1rem base), elegant serif option (Georgia)
- Complete DTCG token structure with all categories (color, typography, spacing, shape, semantic)
- Updated browser token loader to use consolidated BU C tokens.json

**Token Versioning System:**

- Created `tokens/version.json` for core tokens (version 1.0.0)
- Created per-BU version files: `tokens/bu-a/version.json`, `tokens/bu-b/version.json`, `tokens/bu-c/version.json`
- All version files use semver format: `{ "version": "1.0.0" }`

**Token Diff Script:**

- Created `scripts/diff-tokens.ts` for comparing token files/directories
- Supports comparing two token files, two BU directories, or token sets over time
- Outputs human-readable markdown report showing:
  - Added tokens (path and value)
  - Removed tokens (path)
  - Changed tokens (path, old value → new value)
- Uses deep comparison for semantic token changes

**Version Bump Enforcement Script:**

- Created `scripts/check-version-bumps.ts` for enforcing version bumps
- Compares token files with git to detect changes
- Fails if token files changed but version.json unchanged
- Simple rule: Any token change requires at least patch bump
- Documents more complex rules (major for breaking changes) for future implementation

**Package Scripts:**

- Added `tokens:validate` → existing `validate:tokens`
- Added `tokens:diff` → new diff script
- Added `tokens:check-version` → version bump check

**Documentation Updates:**

- Updated `docs/versioning.md` with:
  - Token versioning policy (semver for tokens)
  - How to run token diff locally
  - CI integration guidance
- Updated `docs/adding-a-bu.md` to reflect unified token structure (single tokens.json instead of separate files)
- Created `docs/business-units.md` describing:
  - BU A: Core Banking Platform (conservative, dense)
  - BU B: Growth & Payments Experience (expressive, spacious)
  - BU C: Wealth Management (sophisticated, premium)
  - How they complement each other

**Theme File Updates:**

- Updated `packages/themes/src/bu-c.ts` with descriptive comments about Wealth Management design direction
- Updated `packages/themes/src/index.ts` to include BU C in business unit descriptions

**Next Steps:** Phase 2 - Packaging BU Themes as Consumable Libraries

---

### Phase 2: Packaging BU Themes as Consumable Libraries ✅

**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** 2024-12-21

**Packaging Structure Review:**

- Confirmed `packages/themes` uses `tsup` for building
- Current structure: Single package with named exports (`getBuATheme`, `getBuBTheme`, `getBuCTheme`)
- Decision: Keep single package structure (simpler, less invasive, already works)
- Exports are clear and well-documented

**Build Configuration:**

- Verified `tsup` correctly configured for ESM and CJS output
- Type declarations generated automatically
- React and MUI externalized (not bundled, in dependencies)
- Output format suitable for consumption

**Theme API Clarity:**

- Each BU has clear async loader (`getBuATheme`, `getBuBTheme`, `getBuCTheme`)
- JSDoc comments added to BU C theme describing design direction
- All theme files have descriptive comments

**Internal Consumers:**

- Storybook already uses packaged themes via `@multi-bu/themes`
- Verified `packages/ui` doesn't have circular dependencies
- Demo site (Phase 4) will consume packaged themes

**Documentation:**

- Created `docs/consuming-themes.md` with:
  - Installation instructions (workspace and npm)
